      <p>
        A foundational text for understanding how space is socially produced and actively shaped by capitalism.
        Lefebvre's style is dense and at times mystical, which makes this a challenging read â€” but also an
        incredibly formative one, well worth the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recommended for anyone interested in the politics of urbanism, architecture, and social experiences of space.

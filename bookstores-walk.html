        <h1>A walk along Central London's independent bookstores</h1>
    </header>

    <article>
        <p>If you are a fellow book lover who enjoys a good walk, then London is one of the best places to be.</p>

        <p>In this post, I've plotted a walking tour of London's most iconic independent bookstores.</p>

        <p>I come back to this tour every now and again whenever I want a mixed dose of exercise and inspiration.</p>

        <p>The walk itself is a little less than an hour, and takes you all the way from Regent's canal in King's Cross,
            through Bloomsbury, the part of town long known for its bookshop and literary tradition, and down to Charing
            Cross in the heart of London's vibrant West End.</p>

        <p>Depending on how much time you spend browsing—and, hopefully, shopping—this walk can be the perfect way to
            spend your day in the city and immerse yourself in its literary landscape. There won't be any shortage of
            coffee, lunch, or cake spots along the way either.</p>

        <p>Aside from independent bookstores, the route also passes by some iconic chains, like Foyles and Waterstones.
            Whether you're looking for the latest bestsellers or rare, out-of-print titles, you'll definitely be spoiled
            for choice.</p>

        <a class="map-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/PkzGF8WuSR5BXB6x6" target="_blank">Open route in Google Maps</a>

        <p>Here are the bookstores you'll find on this route.</p>

            <h3>1. Word On The Water - The London Bookbarge</h3>
            <p>"Word on the Water, a bookstore on a barge, is truly a book-lovers paradise. Every nook and cranny of
                this 100-year-old Dutch barge is stacked with neat rows of new and used classics, cult, contemporary
                fiction and a large range of children's books."</p>

                1945, selling new and secondhand publications on progressive politics.</p>

                also have their own cake shop, which not only makes this bookstore one of the prettiest on this list,
                but also the only one that smells strongly of coffee.</p>
